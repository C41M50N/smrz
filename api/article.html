<div class="paperBody shallow">
<p>A common debate in software development projects is between spending time
on improving the quality of the software versus concentrating on releasing
more valuable features. Usually the pressure to deliver functionality
dominates the discussion, leading many developers to complain that they
don't have time to work on architecture and code quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge's Law of headlines</a> is an
adage that says any article with a headline or title that ends in a question
mark can be summarized by ânoâ. Those that know me would not doubt my desire
to subvert such a law. But this article goes further than that - it subverts
the question itself. The question assumes the common trade-off between
quality and cost. With this article I'll explain that this trade-off does
not apply to software - that high quality software is actually cheaper to
produce.</p>
<p>Although most of my writing is aimed at professional software developers,
for this article I'm not going to assume any knowledge of the mechanics of
software development. My hope is that this is an article that can be
valuable to anyone involved with thinking about software efforts,
particularly those, such as business leaders, that act as customers of
software development teams.</p>
<section id="WeAreUsedToATrade-offBetweenQualityAndCost">
<h2>We are used to a trade-off between quality and cost</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in the opening, we are all used to a trade-off between
quality and cost. When I replace my smart phone, I can choose a
more expensive model with faster processor, better screen, and more
memory. Or I can give up some of those qualities to pay less money. It's
not an absolute rule, sometimes we can get bargains where a high quality
good is cheaper. More often we have different values to quality - some people
don't really notice how one screen is nicer than another. But the
assumption is true most of the time, higher quality usually costs more.
</p>
</section>
<section id="SoftwareQualityMeansManyThings">
<h2>Software quality means many things</h2>
<p>If I'm going to talk about quality for software, I need to explain what
that is. Here lies the first complication - there are many things that can
count as quality for software. I can consider the user-interface: does it easily
lead me through the tasks I need to do, making me more efficient and
removing frustrations? I can consider its reliability: does it contain
defects that cause errors and frustration? Another aspect is its
architecture: is the source code divided into clear modules, so that
programmers can easily find and understand which bit of the code they need
to work on this week?</p>
<p>These three examples of quality are not an exhaustive list, but they
are enough to illustrate an important point. If I'm a customer, or user, of
the software, I don't appreciate some of the things we'd refer to as
quality. A user can tell if the user-interface is good. An
executive can tell if the software is making her staff more efficient at
their work. Users and customers will notice defects, particularly should
they corrupt data or render the system inoperative for a while. But
customers and users cannot perceive the architecture of the software.</p>
<p>I thus divide software quality attributes into <b>external</b>
(such as the UI and defects) and <b>internal</b> (architecture). The
distinction is that users and customers can see what makes a software
product have high external quality, but cannot tell the difference between
higher or lower internal quality.</p>
</section>
<section id="AtFirstGlanceInternalQualityDoesNotMatterToCustomers">
<h2>At first glance, internal quality does not matter to customers</h2>
<p>Since internal quality isn't something that customers or users can see
- does it matter? Let's imagine Rebecca and I write an application to
track and predict flight delays. Both our applications do the same
essential function, both have equally elegant user interfaces, and both
have hardly any defects. The only difference is that her internal source
code is neatly organized, while mine is a tangled mess. There is one other
difference: I sell mine for $6 and she sells hers for $10.</p>
<p>Since a customer never sees this source code, and it doesn't affect the
operation of the app, why would anyone pay an extra $4 for Rebecca's software?
Put more generally this should mean that it isn't worth paying more money
for higher internal quality.</p>
<p>Another way I put this is that it makes sense to trade cost for
external quality but it makes no sense to trade cost for internal quality.
A user can judge whether they want to pay more to get a better user
interface, since they can assess whether the user interface is sufficiently
nicer to be worth the extra money. But a user can't see the internal
modular structure of the software, let alone judge that it's better. Why pay
more for something that has no effect?
Since that's the case - why should
any software developer put their time and effort into improving the
internal quality of their work?</p>
</section>
<section id="InternalQualityMakesItEasierToEnhanceSoftware">
<h2>Internal quality makes it easier to enhance software</h2>
<p>So why is it that software developers make an issue out of internal
quality? Programmers spend most of their time modifying code. Even in a
new system, almost all programming is done in the context of an existing
code base. When I want to add a new feature to the software, my first task
is to figure out how this feature fits into the flow of the existing
application. I then need to change that flow to let my feature fit in. I
often need to use data that's already in the application, so I need to
understand what the data represents, how it relates to the data around it,
and what data I may need to add for my new feature.</p>
<p>All of this is about me understanding the existing code. But it's very
easy for software to be hard to understand. Logic can get tangled, the
data can be hard to follow, the names used to refer to things may have
made sense to Tony six months ago, but are as mysterious to me as his
reasons for leaving the company. All of these are forms of what
developers refer to as <b>cruft</b> - the difference between the current code
and how it would ideally be.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p>A common metaphor for cruft is <a href="/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">Technical Debt</a>. The
extra cost on adding features is like paying interest. Cleaning up the
cruft is like paying down the principal. While it's a helpful metaphor,
it does encourage many to believe cruft is much easier to measure and
control than it is in practice.</p>
<div class="photo "><span class="img-link"><a href="/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html"><img src="/bliki/images/tech-debt/sketch.png"></a></span>
<p class="photoCaption"></p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>One of the primary features of internal quality is making it easier for
me to figure out how the application works so I can see how to add things.
If the software is nicely divided into separate modules, I don't have to
read all 500,000 lines of code, I can quickly find a few hundred lines in
a couple of modules. If we've put the effort into clear naming, I can
quickly understand what the various part of the code does without having
to puzzle through the details. If the data sensibly follows the language
and structure of the underlying business, I can easily understand how it
correlates to the request I'm getting from the customer service reps.
Cruft adds to the time it take for me to understand how to make a change,
and also increases the chance that I'll make a mistake. If I spot my mistakes, then
there's more time lost as I have to understand what the fault is and how to
fix it. If I don't spot them, then we get production defects, and more time
spend fixing things later.</p>
<p>My changes also affect the future. I may see a quick way to put in this
feature, but it's a route that goes against the modular structure of the
program, adding cruft. If I take that path, I'll make it quicker for me today, but slow
down everyone else who has to deal with this code in future weeks and
months. Once other members of the team make the same decision, an easy to
modify application can quickly accumulate cruft to the point where every little
change takes many weeks of effort.</p>
</section>
<section id="CustomersDoCareThatNewFeaturesComeQuickly">
<h2>Customers do care that new features come quickly </h2>
<p>Here we see a clue of why internal quality does matter to users and
customers. Better internal quality makes adding new features easier,
therefore quicker and cheaper. Rebecca and I may have the same application
now, but in the next few months Rebecca's high internal quality allows her
to add new features every week, while I'm stuck trying chop through the
cruft to get just a single new feature out. I can't compete with Rebecca's
speed, and soon her software is far more featureful than mine. Then all my customers
delete my app, and get Rebecca's instead, even as she's able to increase
her price.</p>

</section>
<section id="VisualizingTheImpactOfInternalQuality">
<h2>Visualizing the impact of internal quality</h2>
<p>The fundamental role of internal quality is
that it lowers the cost of future change. But there is some extra effort
required to write good software, which does impose some cost in the short term.</p>
<p>A way of visualizing this is with the following pseudo-graph, where I
plot the cumulative functionality of software versus the time (and thus
cost) to produce it. For most software efforts, the curve looks something
like this.</p>
<div class="figure " id="poor.png"><img src="is-quality-worth-cost/poor.png">
<p class="photoCaption"></p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>This is what happens with poor internal quality. Progress is rapid
initially, but as time goes on it gets harder to add new features. Even
small changes require programmers to understand large areas of code, code
that's difficult to understand. When they make changes, unexpected
breakages occur, leading to long test times and defects that need to be
fixed.</p>
<p>Concentrating on high internal quality is about reducing that drop off
in productivity. Indeed some products see an opposite effect, where
developers can accelerate as new features can be easily built by making
use of prior work. This happy situation is a rarer case, as it requires a
skilled and disciplined team to make it happen. But we do occasionally see
it.</p>
<div class="figure " id="both.png"><img src="is-quality-worth-cost/both.png">
<p class="photoCaption"></p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>The subtlety here is that there is a period where the low internal
quality is more productive than the high track. During this time there is
some kind of trade-off between quality and cost. The question, of course,
is: how long is that period before the lines cross?</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-image"><img src=""></p>
<p>We see so much emotional discussion about software process,
design practices and the like. Many of these arguments are impossible
to resolve because the software industry lacks the ability to measure
some of the basic elements of the effectiveness of software
development. In particular we have no way of reasonably measuring
productivity.</p>

<p>At this point we run into why this is a pseudo-graph. There is no way
of measuring the functionality delivered by a software team. This
inability to measure output, and thus productivity, makes it impossible to
put solid numbers on the consequences of low internal quality (which is
also difficult to measure). An inability to measure output is pretty
common among professional work - how do we measure the productivity of
lawyers or doctors?</p>
<p>The way I assess where lines cross is by canvassing the opinion of
skilled developers that I know. And the answer surprises a lot of folks.
Developers find poor quality code significantly slows them down within a
few weeks. So there's not much runway where the trade-off between internal
quality and cost applies. Even small software efforts benefit from
attention to good software practices, certainly something I can attest
from my experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="EvenTheBestTeamsCreateCruft">
<h2>Even the best teams create cruft</h2>
<p>Many non-developers tend to think of cruft as something that only
occurs when development teams are careless and make errors, but even the
finest teams will inevitably create some cruft as they work.</p>
<p>I like to illustrate this point with a tale of when I was chatting with
one of our best technical team leads. He'd just finished a project that
was widely considered to be a great success. The client was happy with the
delivered system, both in terms of its capabilities and its construction
time and cost. Our people were positive about the experience of working on
the project. The tech lead was broadly happy but confessed that the
architecture of the system wasn't that good. I reacted with âhow could
that be - you're one of our best architects?â His reply is one familiar to
any experienced software architect: âwe made good decisions, but only now
do we understand how we should have built itâ.</p>
<p>Many people, including more than a few in the software industry, liken
building software to constructing cathedrals or skyscrapers - after all
why do we use âarchitectâ for senior programmers? But building software
exists in a world of uncertainty unknown to the physical world. Software's
customers have only a rough idea of what features they need in a product
and learn more as the software is built - particularly once early versions
are released to their users. The building blocks of software development -
languages, libraries, and platforms - change significantly every few
years. The equivalent in the physical world would be that customers
usually add new floors and change the floor-plan once half the building is
built and occupied, while the fundamental properties of concrete change
every other year.</p>
<aside class="sidebar" id="DoraStudiesOnEliteTeams">
<h2>Dora studies on elite teams</h2>
<p>The choice between quality and speed isn't the only choice in software
development that makes intuitive sense, but is wrong. There is also a strong
thread of thought that says there is a <a href="/bliki/BimodalIT.html">Bimodal</a> choice
between fast development, with frequent updates to a system, and reliable
systems that don't break in production. That this is a false choice is
proven by the careful scientific work in the <a href="/bliki/StateOfDevOpsReport.html">State Of Dev Ops Report</a>. </p>
<p>For several years they have used statistical
analysis of surveys to tease out the practices of high performing software
teams. Their work has shown that elite software teams update production code
many times a day, pushing code changes from development to production in
less than an hour. As they do this, their change failure rate is
significantly lower than slower organizations so they recover from errors much
more quickly. Furthermore, such elite software delivery organizations are
correlated with higher organizational performance.</p>
</aside>
<p>Given this level of change, software projects are always creating
something novel. We hardly ever find ourselves working on a
well-understood problem that's been solved before. Naturally we learn most
about the problem as we're building the solution, so it's common for me to
hear that teams only really best understand what the architecture of their
software should be after they've spent a year or so building it. Even the
best teams will have cruft in their software.</p>
<p>The difference is that the best teams both create much less cruft but
also remove enough of the cruft they do create that they can continue to
add features quickly. They spend time creating automated tests so that
they can surface problems quickly and spend less time removing bugs. They
refactor frequently so that they can remove cruft before it builds up
enough to get in the way. Continuous integration minimizes cruft
building up due to team members working at cross-purposes. A common
metaphor is that it's like cleaning up work surfaces and equipment in the
kitchen. You can't not make things dirty when you cook, but if you don't
clean things quickly, muck dries up, is harder to remove, and all the
dirty stuff gets in the way of cooking the next dish.</p>
</section>
<section id="HighQualitySoftwareIsCheaperToProduce">
<h2>High quality software is cheaper to produce</h2>
<p>Summing all of this up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neglecting internal quality leads to rapid build up of cruft</li>
<li>This cruft slows down feature development</li>
<li>Even a great team produces cruft, but by keeping internal quality
high, is able to keep it under control</li>
<li>High internal quality keeps cruft to a minimum, allowing a team to
add features with less effort, time, and cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, software developers usually don't do a good job of explaining
this situation. Countless times I've talked to development teams who say
âthey (management) won't let us write good quality code because it takes
too longâ. Developers often justify attention to quality by justifying
through the need for proper professionalism. But this moralistic
argument implies that this quality comes at a cost - dooming their
argument. The annoying thing is that the resulting crufty code both makes
developers' lives harder, and costs the customer money. When thinking about
internal quality, I stress that we should only approach it as an economic argument.
High internal quality reduces the cost of future features, meaning that
putting the time into writing good code actually reduces cost.</p>
<p>This is why the question that heads this article misses the point. The
âcostâ of high internal quality software is negative. The usual trade-off
between cost and quality, one that we are used to for most decisions in
our life, does not make sense with the internal quality of software. (It
does for external quality, such as a carefully crafted user-experience.)
Because the relationship between cost and internal quality is an unusual
and counter-intuitive relationship, it's usually hard to absorb. But
understanding it is critical to developing software at maximum
efficiency.</p>

<h2>Measuring the effects of low internal quality</h2>
<p><i>(added: 2024-01-29)</i></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, we don't really know how to measure internal
quality, or productivity, and so it's difficult to get quantifiable
evidence for the importance of internal quality. However in recent years,
there has been increasing efforts to try.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting paper that I've come across is this study
from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04374">Adam Tornhill and Markus Borg</a>.
They use their proprietary tool, CodeScene, to determine the health level
of files in 39 proprietary code bases. They found that resolving issues in
low quality took more than twice as long as doing so in high quality code,
and that low quality code had 15 times higher defect density.</p>
